# OLS Troubleshooting and Diagnostics

## Multi-Collinearity

### Perfect Collinearity

In order to estimate unique $\hat{\beta}$ OLS requires the that the columns of the design matrix $\vec{X}$ are linearly independent.

Common examples of groups of variables that are not linearly independent:

- Categorical variables in which there is no excluded category.
  You can also include all categories of a categorical variable if you exclude the intercept.
  Note that although they are not (often) used in political science, there are other methods of transforming categorical variables to ensure the columns in the design matrix are independent.
- A constant variable. This can happen in practice with dichotomous variables of rare events; if you drop some observations for whatever reason, you may end up dropping all the 1's in the data. So although the variable is not constant in the population, in your sample it is constant and cannot be included in the regression.
- A variable that is a multiple of another variable. E.g. you cannot include $\log(\text{GDP in millions USD})$ and $\log({GDP in USD})$ since $\log(\text{GDP in millions USD}) = \log({GDP in USD}) / 1,000,000$. in 
- A variable that is the sum of two other variables. E.g. you cannot include $\log(population)$, $\log(GDP)$, $\log(GDP per capita)$ in a regression since 
$$\log(\text{GDP per capita}) = \log(\text{GDP} / \text{population}) = \log(\text{GDP}) - \log(\text{population})$$.


#### What to do about it?

R and most statistical programs will run regressions with collinear variables, but will drop variables until only linearly independent columns in $\mat{X}$ remain.

For example, consider the following code. The variable `type` is a categorical variable with categories "bc", "wc", and "prof".
It will 
```{r}
data(Duncan, package = "car")
# Create dummy variables for each category
Duncan <- mutate(Duncan,
                 bc = type == "bc",
                 wc = type == "wc",
                 prof = type == "prof")
lm(prestige ~ bc + wc + prof, data = Duncan)
```
R runs the regression, but coefficient and standard errors for `prof` are set to `NA`.

You should not rely on the software to fix this for you; once you (or the software) notices the problem check the reasons it occurred. The rewrite your regression to remove whatever was creating linearly dependent variables in $\mat{X}$.



### Less-than Perfect Collinearity

What happens if variables are not linearly dependent, but nevertheless highly correlated?
If $\Cor(\vec{x}_1, vec{x}_2) = 1$, then they are linearly dependent and the regression cannot be estimated (see above).
But if $\Cor(\vec{x}_1, vec{x}_2) = 0.99$, the OLS can estimate unique values of of $\hat\beta$. However, it everything was fine with OLS estimates until, suddenly, when there is linearly independence everything breaks. The answer is yes, and no.
As $|\Cor(\vec{x}_1, \vec{x}_2)| \to 1$ the standard errors on the coefficients of these variables increase, but OLS as an estimator works correctly; $\hat\beta$ and $\se{\hat\beta}$ are unbiased. 
With multicollinearly, OLS gives you the "right" answer, but it cannot say much with certainty.

#### What to do about it?

Remember multicollinearity does not violate the assumptions of OLS. If all the other assumptions hold, then OLS is giving you unbiased coefficients and standard errors. What multicollinearity is indicating is that you may not be able to answer the question with the precision you would like.

1. If the variable(s) of interest are highly correlated with other variables, then it means that there is not enough variation, controlling for other factors. You may check that you are not controlling for "post-treatment" variables.  Dropping control variables if they are correctly included will bias your estimates. But otherwise, there is little you can do other than get more data. You could re-consider your research design and question. What does it mean if there is that little variation in the treatment variable after controlling for other factors? 
2. If control variables are highly correlated with each other, it does not matter. You should not be interpreting their coefficients, so their standard errors do not matter. In fact, controlling for several similar, but correlated variables, may be useful in order to offset measurement error in any one of them.

## Omitted Variable Bias

### What's the problem?


### What to do about it?

Summary:

1. OVB is intrinsic to observational methods relying on selection on observables---not just regression.
2. Control for all plausible "pre-treatment" variables
2. Reason about possible biases due to OVB
3. Sensitivity of coefficients to inclusion of control variables is an indication of the plausibility of OVB. Altonji et. al. formalize this.

In practice, this is a primary problem of many papers and papers; and for good reason, it biases the coefficient of interest. Reviewers and discussants will often ask about whether you have considered controlling for *foo*. Although these may be legitimate concerns, not all commenters understand the purpose of control variables. There two arguments to consider when addressing these arguments.

1. The omitted variable has to plausibly be correlated with *both* the variable of interest *and* the outcome variable, and the burden is on the commenter to provide at a confounding variable and plausible relationships. Simpy stating that there could be an unobservable variable is trivially true, uninteresting, and not a fatal critique. That said, the evidentiary content of your methods would be higher if you used methods less susceptible to potential unobserved confounders.
2. The omitted variable should be a *good* control and not a "post treatment" variable. If the omitted variable should not be one of the causal pathways by which $X$ affects $Y$, it should not be controlled for. If $Z$ affects the values of $X$ and also affects $Y$, then it needs to be controlled for.

There are two common ways of assessing plausibility.

1. **Informal method**. This is what you see in many empirical papers. Estimate the model including different control variables.
The less sensitive the coefficient(s) of the variables of interest are to the inclusion of control variables, the more plausible it is that the variable of interest is not sensitive to unobserved variables [@AngristPischke2013]. @Oster2013 states

    > A common heuristic for evaluating the robustness of a result to omitted variable bias concerns is to look
    > at the sensitivity of the treatment effect to inclusion of observed controls. In three top general interest
    > economics journals in 2012, 75% of non-experimental empirical papers included such sensitivity analysis. The
    > intuitive appeal of this approach lies in the idea that the bias arising from the observed controls is informative
    > about the bias that arises from the unobserved ones. 

    Note that what is important is that the *coefficient* is stable to the inclusion of controls, not that the coefficient remains statistically significant (which seems to be what many authors focus on).

2. **Formal method** Several papers, including @AltonjiElderTaber2005, @BellowsMiguel2009, and Oster2013, formalize the intuition behind the heuristic of coefficient stability to assess the sensitivity of the treatment to OVB.

**TODO** Insert path diagram.

OVB is a intrinsic problem in observational research, and there is nothing you can do to ever ensure that you have controlled for all relevant variables (however, all inference is uncertain, even the designs discussed next, so people should learn to deal with uncertainty).
Also, methods such as matching, propensity scores, or inverse weighting still depend on assumptions about selection on observables, even if they may be less sensitive to certain kinds of modeling assumptions.
The alternative is to use designs which do not require directly controlling for observable differences. Examples of these designs include: experiments (obviously), natural experiments, instrumental variables, and regression discontinuity.


## Measurement Error

### What's the problem?



### What to do about it?

There's no easy fix within the OLS framework.

1. If the measurement error is in the variable of interest, then the variable will be biased towards zero, and your estimate is too large.
2. Find better measures with lower measurement errors. If the variable is the variable of interest, then perhaps combine multiple variables into a single index. If the measurement error is in the control variables, then include several measures. That these measure correlate closely increases their standard errors, but the control variables are not the object of the inferential analysis.
3. More complicated methods: errors in variable models, structural equation models, instrumental variable (IV) models, and Bayesian methods.

## Non-linearity

## Non-constant Variances

### Heteroskedasticity

Note, that OLS assumes that the variance of the the disturbances is constant $\hat{Y} - Y = \varepsilon = \sigma^2$.
What happens if it isn't? 

The homoskedastic case assumes that each error term has its own variance. 
In the heteroskedastic case, each disturbance may have its own variance, but they are still uncorrelated ($\mat{\Sigma}$ is diagonal)
$$
\mat{\Sigma} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_1^2 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
0 & \sigma_2^2 & \cdots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & \cdots & \sigma_N^2
\end{bmatrix}
$$
The problem is that now there are $N$ variance parameters to estimate, in addition to the $K$ slope coefficients.
Now, there are more parameters than we can estimate.
With heteroskedasticity, OLS with be unbiased, but the standard errors will be incorrect.


### Auto-correlation


More general case allows for heteroskedasticity, and autocorrelation ($\Cov(\varepsilon_i, \varepsilon_j) \neq 0$),
$$
\mat{\Sigma} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_1^2 & \sigma_{1,2} & \cdots & \sigma_{1,N} \\
\sigma_{2,1} & \sigma_2^2 & \cdots & \sigma_{2,N} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\sigma_{N,1} & \sigma_{N,2} & \cdots & \sigma_N^2
\end{bmatrix} 
$$
As with heteroskedasticity, OLS with be unbiased, but the standard errors will be incorrect.

### Clustered Standard Errors
