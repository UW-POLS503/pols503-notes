# Types of Questions

1. Descriptive: Represent data $X$ by a smaller number of values
2. Predictive: Given some $X$, what is the value of $Y$?
3. Causal: If I change $X$, what will the value of $Y$ be?

Causal questions 

> A variable $X$ is a cause of *variable* $Y$ if $Y$ in any way relies on $X$ for its value. ... $X$ is a cause of $Y$ if $Y$ listens to $X$ and decides its value in response to what it hears. Pearl et al. p. 5.
