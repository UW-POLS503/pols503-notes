# Differences-in-Differences


- Parallel trends: Primary identification assumption is *parallel trends* The idea that the non-treated group follows the trend that the treated group *would have* is it was non-treated.

- Estimate with state and year fixed effects
- Checking parallel trends. Can include unit-level trends. See Figs 5.4--5.6 in @AngristPischke2014a [p. 198] for good illustrtions of when this works and doesnt.

Population weighting regressions [@AngristPischke2014a , p. 202]. Claims that regresions for pop causal effects should be weighted. However, this isn't quite correct.

## Examples

- @RichardsonTroost2009a: compare bank closures of Mississippi banks in the 6th and 8th Federal Reserve districts during the Great Depresssion. Discussed in @AngristPischke2014a [Ch. 4].
- John Snow's cholera study [see `r rdoc("HistData", "Snow")`] can be considered an early diff-in-diff [@AngristPischke2014a, p. 204]
