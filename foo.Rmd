$$
Y_{i,t} = \delta_t + \tau A_{i,t} + \alpha_i + \eta_{i,t}
$$
Where
- $\delta_t$ is a period/time effect
- $\alpha_i$ is a unit effect
- $\eta_{i,t}$ is a mean 0 transitory shock

Suppose the treatment is uncorrelated with the errors:
$$
\Pr(A_{i,1} = 1| \eta_{i,0}, \eta_{i,1}) = \Pr(A_{i,1} = 1)
$$

- Also functions of errors are indep of the treatemtn.
- Trends in outcome are uncorrelated with treatment, so treatment and control groups would have same trends

$$
Y_{i,t} = \delta_t t + \gamma A_{i,1} + \tau A_{i,t} + \epsilon_{i,t}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}[t]
\epsilon_{i,t} &= \alpha_i - \E(\alpha_i | A_{i,1}) + \eta_{i,t} & \text{new error} \\
\delta &= (\delta_1 - \delta_0) & \text{initial mean for control group} \\
\mu &= E(\alpha_i | A_{i,1} = 0) + \delta_0 & \text{initial mean of the control group} \\
\gamma &= E(\alpha_i | A_{i,1} = 1) - E(\alpha_i | A_{i,1} = 0) & \text{difference between treatment and control groups}
\end{aligned}
$$

Threats to identification:

- Treatment is independent of idiosyncratic shocks.
- Independence of treatment and idiosyncratic shocks may be conditional on covariates.

Regression

When assumption holds conditional on covariates,
$$
Y_{i,t} = \mu + X'_t \beta_t + \delta_t t + \gamma A_{i,1} + \tau A_{i,t} + \epsilon_{i,t}
$$

$$
Y_{i,1} - Y_{i,0} = \delta + X'_i \beta +  \tau (A_{i,t} - A_{i,0}) + (\epsilon_{i,1} - \epsilon_{i,0})
$$
$\beta = \beta_1 - \beta_0$. Everyone treated in first period, $A_{i1} - A_{i0} = A_{i1}$.

- Regress change on $Y_i$ on the treatment and covariates.
- Depends on constante effects, linearity of the effect of $X_i$.


Serial Correlation and Placebo Tests

DID tend to have serial correlation of the dependent variables. This affects the standard errors.

- Bertrand, DuÄ˜o, and Mullainathan (2004) show that a serial correlation can lead to random, no-efect intervention being
    significant 45% of the time at the 5% level.
- Placebo test: randomly assign the treatment to generate the null hypothesis distribution.
- Why: DID time series are serieally correlated with long pre- and post- treatment.
- What to do?

    - cluster robust standard errors
    - block bootstrap
    - aggregate pre-intervention and post-intervention time periods.

Robustness Checks

- Leads and lags: current and lagged values of $A_{i,t}$ shoudl affect $Y_{i,t}$ but not future values
- Time trends: If more than two periods, add unit specific linear trends to assess whether the parallel trends assumption is
    problematic.
