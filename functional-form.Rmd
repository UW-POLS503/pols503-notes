## Logarithm

### Examples of Relevant Theories

- Converts multiplicative theories to additive theories. Theories with diminishing returns to scale. Theories about percentage changes or growth.
- Most uses of (per capita) GDP, population: 
- Cobb-Douglas growth
  $$
  y = \alpha (K^(\delta) L^(1 - \delta))^{\nu}
  $$
  Linearized,
  $$
  \log y = \log \alpha + \log k
  $$
- Gravity trade equation
- Lanchester law for casualties
  $$
  \Delta x = \alpha x^\beta y^\gamma
  $$
  where $\Delta x$ are casualties per period, $x$ is the initial size of forces forces, and $y$ are opposing forces.
  This can be linearized and estimated with OLS,
  $$
  \log \Delta x = \log \alpha + \beta \log x + \gamma \log y
  $$
  as long as $x, y > 0$ (and preferrably large).

## Miscellaneous 

### Square Root and Variance Stabalizing Transformations

### Power-Transformation

## Polynomials 

### Squared

#### What theories?

- Kuznets curve: economic development and inequality
- Environmental Kuznets curve: environmental quality and economic development
- Democratic Civil Peace: intermediate regimes prone to civil war, democracies and autocracies are less prone to civil war.

### Higher-Order Polynomials

- Time cubed
- Seat-Vote curves? Other old examples in Tufte 1975
- These are generally 

## Interactions

Standard errors are more difficult to calculate. See Golder's page, and Aiken and West (1991).

### Theories

Golder et. al recommend that for simple interaction model such as:
$$
\vec{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_x \vec{x} + \beta_z \vec{z} + \beta_{xz} \vec{x} \vec{z} + \vec{varepsilon}
$$
the reseearcher make as many of the following predictions as possible

1. The marginal effect of $X$ is (positive, negative, zero) when $Z$ is at its **lowest** level.
2. ... when $Z$ is at its **highest** level.
3. The marginal effect of $Z$ is (positive, negative, zero) when $X$ is at its lowest level.
4. ... when $X$ is at its **highest** level.
5. The marginal effect of each $X$ and $Z$ is (positively, negatively) related to the other variable


### Recommendations

Golder et al recommend

1. Use multiplicative interaction models for conditional hypotheses.
2. Include all constituent terms of the interaction in the model.
3. Do not interpret coefficients on terms seperately, or as if they are unconditional marginal effects.
4. Calculate substantively meaningful marginal effects and their standard errors.


### Plots

Golder et al recommend:

1. Construct marginal effect plots for both X and Z.
2. The range of the horizontal axis should extend from the minimum to the maximum value of variable in the sample.
3. The plot should include a frequency distribution of the variable of interest, as either a rug plot, histogram, or density.
4. Report the product term coefficient and its t-statistic or standard error.
