# Regression Diagnostics

Several packages in R provide large collections of regression diagnostics:

- [lmtest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lmtest/index.html)
- [car](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/car/index.html)

Reading the vignettes or documentation of these packages is a good overview of available regression diagnostics.
Also see the [Econometrics Task View](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Econometrics.html).

@Fox2016a has a particularly extensive overview of regression diagnostics.

Though for Stata, [this tutorial](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/stata/webbooks/reg/chapter2/statareg2.htm) has an overview of many regression diagnostics.
