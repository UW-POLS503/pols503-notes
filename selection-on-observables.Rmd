# Selection on Observables

## Theory

The key assumption for causal inference with observational data in the absence of randomization is *selection on observables*, *conditional independence assumption (CIA)*, or *ignorability*.

$$
y_{0}, y_{1} \perp T | X
$$
This means that the distribution of the potential outcomes, $y_{0}, y_{1}$ is independent of the treatement conditional on observing the control variables $X$.
Another way of stating this is that the treatment is *as if randomly* assigned, conditional on the controls.

CIA is effectively a *no omitted variables* assumption.
