## Longitudinal Data

Longitudinal data

Repeated observations for 

- across $N$ units (e.g. countries, states, individuals, parties)
- over $T$ time-periods (e.g. years, months, days, sample waves)

There is an important distinction between longitudinal data where $N$ is small 
and $T$ is large, and those in which $T$ is small and $N$ is large.

- Time-series cross-section (TSCS): big $T$. many political economy data sets with countries observerved over many years.
- Panel: small $T$, bib $N$.

This disinction is important for the methods that are used.
The distinction is not necessarily whether $N > T$ or $N < T$. 
The importance is that different methods had asymptotic properties that depend on $T \to infty$, $N \to \infty$, or $N \times T \to \infty$. 
This means that some methods that work well for panels with many individuals with a few observations will not work well for data with a few individuals and with many repeated observations, and vice-versa.
One of the first things to check when encountering a new panel model is which of these cases it works well.

Hierarchical (multilevel/nested) data is a similar concept, in which data are nested.
For example,

- students within classrooms
- survey respondents within districts within countries

While these are different, some hierarchical models can be useful for modeling panel data.

LDV or ECM with PCSE ? 

The longer your time-series, the more you do not need to pool information across units and can model the data within each unit using a time-series model.
