In these methods there are repeated measurements of the same unit over time. 
This requires different methods and also has implications for causal inference.
While simply having panel data does not identify an effect, it allows the researcher to claim identification using different assumptions than simply selection on observables (as in the cross-sectional case).

## Terminology

There are several closely related concepts and terminology to cover.

Panel (lognitudinal) data 

:    small $T$, large $N$

Time series cross-section data 

For the purposes of causal inference, identification relies on the same assumptions.
However, different estimators work differently under different data types. 
Some estimators work well as $N \to \infty$, some as $T \to \infty$, and usually these are not the same. 
Additionally, longer time series may require and/or have enough data for the researcher to estimate serial correlation in the errors.

There are some additional related concepts that should also be mentioned at this time, hopefully to spare the reader future confusion (and not to add to it):

Hierarchical Models

:    units nested within groups. E.g. children in schools, districts within states

Time-series Models

:    large $T$, usually $N = 1$, or the different units modeled separately.

Terminology can be confusing and varies across fields and literatures.
In particular, fixed effects and random effects are used differently and often estimated differently in statistics and econometrics. 
This is easily seen by comparing the **lme4** and **plm** packages in R which bost estimate fixed and random effects models.
Hierarchical models will often used fixed and random effects even though there is no *time* component, and thus they are not longitudinal models.
The reason that I bring up this terminology is that if you search for fixed and random effects you can quickly be confused when it seems that people are talking about seemingly different concepts; they more of less may be.

## Fixed Effects

In a fixed effects model, each unit $i$ has its own effect,
$$
Y_{i,t} = X_{i,t}\T \beta + u_i + \varepsilon_{i,t} .
$$
This means that if instead of estimating the equation above,
we estimate the pooled OLS model,
$$
y_{i,t} = \vec{x}\T_{i,t} \hat{\vec{\beta}}_{\text{pool}} + \tilde{\varespilon}_{i,t} ,
$$
the estimate of $\hat{\vec{\beta}}_{\text{pool}}$ will be biased if $\Cov(\vec{u}, \vec{x}_{k})$ for any of the covariates and $\Cov(\vec{u}, \vec{y})$.
This is a case of omitted variable bias, where the unit effects, $u_i$, are the omitted variables.

### Estimating

There are a couple of approaches



### Causal Inference

**TODO**


## Lagged Dependent Variables

A different model is to assume a lagged dependent variable,
$$
Y_{i,t} = \rho Y'_{i,t-1} + X'_{i,t} \beta + \varepsilon_{i,t}
$$
This captures some of the unit-specific aspects that the fixed effects capture.
However, the LDV model is making a different assumption than fixed effects. 
The FE model assumes that each unit has a seperate effect that is constant over time, while the LDV model assumes that anything specific about a unit is captured through the value of the dependent variable in the previous period.

Beck and Katz recommendation of LDV with PCSE.

The LDV and Fixed Effects models make different assumptions, and they are not nested.
So why not combine them into a single model? 
$$
Y_{i,t} = \rho Y'_{i,t-1} + X'_{i,t} \beta + \alpha_i + \varepsilon_{i,t} .
$$
There is a problem with this approach. OLS is biased. The fixed effect estimator includes demeaned values of the outcome variable and covariates. So the FE model with a LDV will use $Y_{i,t - 1} - \bar{Y}_{i,t-1}$. This average includes $Y_{i,t}$ and $Y_{i,t} = ... + \varepsilon_{i,t}$. Thus by construction, $Y_{i,t} - \bar{Y}_{i,t-1}$ is correlated with the errors.

So what can we do about this? There are two options.

1. Ignore it. The bias is proportional to $1/T$. In panels with 20 or more periods, the bias may be small. Moreover, the bias is generally largest in the coefficient of the lagged dependent variable itself, which may not be of primarny interest. Accept the bias.
2. Use both LDV and FE models. The LDV and FE methods can bound the effects of the coefficient of interest. See Angrist and Pischke.
3. Use IV methods to instrument the lagged dependent variable. See Arrellano-Bond methods. 

This is a case where the difference between panel and TSCS is important.
In many TSCS settings with larger $T$ it is probably fine to estimate fixed effects with LDV.
However, if you have panel data model with few $T$, then you should use either method 2 or 3.


## Random Effects

Consider the panel data model,
$$
Y_{i,t} = \alpha + X'_{i,t} \beta + u_i + \varepsilon_{i,t}
$$
In fixed effect, the errors are assumed to be uncorrelated with both the unit effects and the covariates,
$$
\E(\varepsilon_{i,t} | X_{i}, u_i) = 0 .
$$
With random effects we make an additional assumption, the unit effects are uncorrelated with the covariates,
$$
\E(u_i | X_i) = \E(u_i) = 0 .
$$

What this means that under the assumptions of random effects, omitting $u_i$ would not bias $\beta$ since they are assumed to be uncorrelated with $X$. Thus, there's no omitted variable bias.

So why use random effects? To fix standard errors.
$$
Y_{i,t} = X'_{i,t} \beta + \nu_i
$$
where $\nu_i = u_i + \varepsilon_{i,t}$.
However, this means that
$$
\cov(Y_{i,1}, Y_{i,2} | X_{i,t}) = \sigma^2_u .
$$
This violates the OLS assumption of non-autocorrelation.
Using random effects gets consistent standard errors.


### How to estimate random effects?

There are a variety of methods, but the econometric method is to use **quasi-demeaning** or **partial pooling**,
$$
(Y_{i,t} - \theta \bar{Y}_i) = (X_{i,t} - \bar{X}_i)' \beta + (\nu_{i,t} - \theta \var{\nu}_i)
$$
where $\theta \in [0, 1]$ where $\theta = 0$ is OLS, and $\theta = 1$ is fixed effects.
Some math (TM) shows,
$$
\theta = 1 - \left( \sigma_u^2 / (\sigma^2_u + T \sigma^2_epsilon) \right)^{1/2} .
$$
The **random effects estimator** runs pooled OLS on this model, but replaces $\theta$ with the estimate $\hat{\theta}$.

See the R package **plm**.

The R package **lme4** and Bayesian methods, e.g. Gelman and Hill, take a different approach to estimating random effects.
