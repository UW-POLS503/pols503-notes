<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Joint vs. Conditional models</h2>
<p>In most problems, the researcher is concerned with <em>relationships</em> between multiple variables. For example, suppose that we want to model the relationship between two variables, <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. There are two main approaches to modeling this relationship.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>joint model:</strong> Jointly model <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(f(Y, X)\)</span>. For example, we can model <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> as coming from a bivariate normal distribution.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
<li><strong>conditional model:</strong> Model <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> as a conditional function of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. This means we calculate a function of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> for each value of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Most often we focus on modeling a conditional statistic of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, and linear regression will focus on modeling the conditional mean of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\E(Y | X)\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dt>regression (conditional) model</dt>
<dd><span class="math inline">\(p(y | x_1, \dots, x_k) = f(x_1, \dots, x_k)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_1, \dots, x_k\)</span> are given.
</dd>
<dt>joint model</dt>
<dd><span class="math inline">\(p(y, x_1, \dots, x_k) = f(y, x_1, \dots, x_k)\)</span>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If we knew the joint model we could calculate the conditional model, <span class="math display">\[
(y | x_1, \dots, x_k) = \frac{p(y, x_1, \dots, x_k)}{p(x_1, \dots, x_k)} .
\]</span> However, especially when there are specific outcome variables of interest, the <em>conditional model</em>, i.e. regression, is easier because the analyst can focus on modeling how <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> varies with respect to <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, without necessarily having to model the process by which <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is generated. However, that very convenience of not modeling the process which generates <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> will be the problem when regression is used for causal inference on observational data.</p>
<p>At its most general, “<em>regression analysis</em>, broadly construed, traces the distribution of a response variable (denoted by <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>)—or some characteristic of this distribution (such as its mean)—as a function of one of more explanatory variables <span class="citation">(Fox <a href="#ref-Fox2016a">2016</a>, 15)</span>.” is a procedure that is used to summarize <em>conditional</em> relationships. That is, the average value of an outcome variable conditional on different values of one or more explanatory variables.</p>
<p>While this section will generally cover linear regression, it is not the only form of <strong>regression</strong>. So let’s start with a definition of regression.</p>
<p>Most generally, a regression represents a function of a variable, <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> as a function of another variable or variables, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, and and error. <span class="math display">\[
g(Y_i) = f(X_i) + \text{error}_i
\]</span></p>
<p>The <strong>conditional expectation function</strong> (CEF) or <strong>regression function</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> given <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is denoted, <span class="math display">\[
\mu(x) = \E\left[Y | X = x\right]
\]</span></p>
<p>But if regression represents <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> as a function of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, what’s the alternative? Instead of modeling <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> as a function of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, we could jointly model both <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. A regression model of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> would be multivariate function, <span class="math inline">\(f(Y, X)\)</span>. In machine learning these approaches are sometimes called <strong>descriminative</strong> (regression) and <strong>generative</strong> (joint models) models.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Discrete Covariates</h3>
<p>Before turning to considering continuous variable, it is useful to consider the conditional expectation function for a discrete <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>
<p>Consider the <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/topics/Titanic">datasets</a> dataset included in the recommended R package <strong><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=datasets">datasets</a></strong>.

<ul>
<li>Note that we haven’t made any assumptions about distributions of the variables.</li>
<li>In this case, the outcome variable in the CEF was a binary variable, and we calculated a proportion. However, the proportion is the expected value (mean) of a binary variable, so the calculation of the CEF wouldn’t change.</li>
<li>If we continued to condition on more discrete variables, the number of observed cell sizes would get smaller and smaller (and possibly zero), with larger standard errors.</li>

<p>But what happens if the conditioning variables are continuous?</p>
<p><span class="citation">Galton (<a href="#ref-Galton1886a">1886</a>)</span> examined the joint distribution of the heights of parents and their children. He was estimating the average height of children conditional upon the height of their parents. He found that this relationship was approximately linear with a slope of 2/3.</p>
<p>This means that on average taller parents had taller children, but the children of taller parents were on average shorter than they were, and the children of shorter parents were on average taller than they were. In other words, the children’s height was more average than parent’s height.</p>
<p>This phenomenon was called regression to the mean, and the term regression is now used to describe conditional relationships (Hansen 2010).</p>
<p>His key insight was that if the marginal distributions of two variables are the same, then the linear slope will be less than one.</p>
<p>He also found that when the variables are standardized, the slope of the regression of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are the same. They are both the correlation between <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, and they both show regression to the mean.</p>
