His basic rules are Listen to the Gentiles Question the question Dare to be silly Simplify, simplify See Hal Varian. How to build an Economic Model in your spare time The first step is to get an idea. This is not all that hard to do. The tricky part is to get a good idea. The way you do this is to come up with lots and lots of ideas and throw out all the ones that aren’t good. But where to get ideas, that’s the question. Most graduate students are convinced that the way you get ideas is to read journal articles. But in my experience journals really aren’t a very good source of original ideas. You can get lots of things from journal articles—technique, insight, even truth. But most of the time you will only get someone else’s ideas. … My suggestion is rather different: I think that you should look for your ideas outside the academic journals—in newspapers, in magazines, in conversations, and in TV and radio programs. … Conversations, especially with people in business, are often very fruitful. Commerce is conducted in many ways, and most of them have never been subjected to a serious economic analysis. … In many cases your ideas can come from your own life and experiences. … Before you start trying to decide whether your idea is correct, you should stop to ask whether it is interesting. If it isn’t interesting, no one will care whether it is correct or not. So try it out on a few people—see if they think that it is worth pursuing. What would follow from this idea if it is correct? … The first thing that most graduate students do is they rush to the literature to see if someone else had this idea already. However, my advice is to wait a bit before you look at the literature. Eventually you should do a thorough literature review, of course, but I think that you will do much better if you work on your idea for a few weeks before doing a systematic literature search…. Greg Mankiw, My Rules of Thumb: Coming up with ideas is the hardest and least controllable part of the research process. It is somewhat easier if you have broad interests. Most obviously, broad interests give you more opportunities for success. A miner is more likely to strike gold if he looks over a large field than over the same field over and over again Also the links in this Greg Mankiw Advice for Grad Students 2.3 Replications Gary King has advice on how to turn a replication into a publishable paper: Gary King How to Write a Publishable Paper as a Class Project Gary King. 2006. “Publication, Publication.” PS: Political Science and Politics.

["typesetting-and-word-processing-programs.html", "Chapter 3 Typesetting and Word Processing Programs 3.1 LaTeX 3.2 Word", " Chapter 3 Typesetting and Word Processing Programs 3.1 LaTeX LaTeX is a document markup language (think something like HTML) that is widely used in academia.1 Its primary advantages over Word (and word processors) are the separation of content and presentation and its formatting of mathematical equations. In addition to papers, it is often used for academic slides; many talk slides are prepared with beamer. 3.1.1 Learning LaTeX Here are some links to get started learning LaTeX: Overleaf Free &amp; Interactive Online Introduction to LaTeX LaTeX Tutorial has interactive lessons ShareLaTeX Documentation Overleaf Example Templates has many different examples of LaTeX documents. LaTeX Wikibook Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX is a classic, but not as as newby friendly as the others. 3.1.2 Using LaTeX Use an online service such as Overleaf or ShareTeX. These are great for collaboration, but become inflexible when you want to customize your workflow. Write it with a specialized editor such as TeXmaker, TeXStudio, or TeXshop. These generally have built ways to insert text, and also live preview. I would stay away from editors such as LyX that are WYSWYG. Write it with an general purpose editor such as Atom or Sublime Text.2 Most editors have a plugin to make writing LaTeX easier. For Atom there is LaTeXTools, and for Sublime Text, LaTeXTools 3.1.3 LaTeX with R This is pretty easy. Rnw, also called Sweave, documents allow you to mix R chunks with LaTeX. This is similar to R markdown, but with LaTeX instead of markdown.3 knitr. Many packages, such as xtable](https://cran.r-project.org/package=xtable), stargazer, or texreg produce formatted output in LaTeX. When you use these programs, do not copy and paste the output. Instead, save it to a file, and use \\input{} to include the contents in your document. 3.1.4 My workflow At the moment, I use emacs with AucTeX for writing pure LaTeX documents. However, I’ve started using Atom more and more as a general text editor. I use RStudio for writing Rnw files. For papers, I haven’t moved to using (R) markdown and pandoc yet, because I find the layout and reference support still too limiting; I end up writing enough LaTeX that I figure I might as well write the whole thing in LaTeX. I’ve been using Overleaf for coauthoring in a couple of cases. I often build my document using Makefiles. 3.2 Word While I use LaTeX in my own work, Microsoft Word is powerful piece of software, and many of the complaints against Word come down to not being aware of its features. There are many tools you can use to build your research paper; whatever tool you use, learn how to use it proficiently. 3.2.1 General Advice This guide on using Microsoft Word for Dissertations covers everything and more that I would have. Also see this separate presentation and content using styles Automatically number figures and tables Use a reference manager like Mendeley, Zotero, Colwiz, or Papers. They have plugins for citations in Word. When exporting figures for Word, if you must use a raster graphic use PNG files (not JPEG). For publication, use a high DPI (600) with PNG graphics. Learn to use Fields. You can insert figures from files that you can update using Insert &gt; Field &gt; Links and References &gt; IncludePicture. This is useful for programmatically generating figures to insert into your document. Likewise, you can insert text from files that you can update using Insert &gt; Field &gt; Links and References &gt; IncludeText. 3.2.2 Using R with Word For a dynamic reports you can use R Markdown and export to a word document. When doing this, use a reference document to set the the styles that you will use. See Happy collaboration with Rmd to docx for more advice on using R Markdown with Word. When using functions from packages such as xtable, stargazer, or texreg output HTML, which can be copy and pasted into word. Finally, the [ReporteR][Create Word documents from R](http://davidgohel.github.io/ReporteRs/word.html) package is an alternative method to generate Word Documents from R. TeX is pronounced as “teck” because the X is a Greek chi. The pronunciation of of LaTeX is thus lah-teck or lay-teck. It is not pronounced like the rubber compund. See this StackExchange question on the pronunciation of LaTeX.↩ And of course Vim or Emacs.↩ And Sweave files preceded R markdown and knitr by many years.↩ "],
