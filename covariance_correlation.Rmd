# Correlation and Covariance


The population covariance for random variables $X$ and $Y$ is,
$$
\Cov(X, Y) = \E[(X - \mu_x)(Y - \mu_y)]
$$

The sample covariance for vectors $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$ is,
$$
\Cov(x_i, y_i) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})
$$

Some properties of covariance are:

- $\Cov(X, X) = \Var(X, X)$. Why?
- $\Cov(X, Y)$ has a domain of $(-\infty, \infty)$. What would a covariance of $-\infty$ look like? of $\infty$? of 0?

Like variance is defined on the scale of the squared variable ($X^2$), the covariance is defined on the scale of the product of the variables ($X Y$), which makes it difficult to interpret.

However unlike taking the square root of the variables, in correlation is standardized to a domain of $[-1, 1]$.
$$
\Cor(X, Y) = \frac{\E[(X - \mu_x)(Y - \mu_y)]}{\sigma_x \sigma_y}
$$
$$
\Cor(x_i, y_i) = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{s_x s_y}
$$
