# Coming to R from other Languages

## Stata

There are not as many of these as I would have expected.
These are the only useful ones that I found.

- Matthieu Gomez "R for Stata Users". <http://www.princeton.edu/~mattg/statar/>
- EconometricsBySimulation. "Dictionary: Stata to R" <https://github.com/EconometricsBySimulation/RStata/wiki/Dictionary:-Stata-to-R>
- DataCamp course *R for SAS, SPSS and Stata Users". <https://www.datacamp.com/courses/r-for-sas-spss-and-stata-users-r-tutorial>
- Muenchen, Robert A. and Joseph Hilbe. 2010. *R for Stata Users* <http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-1-4419-1318-0>. 
  Useful, although R has changed a surprisingly large amount in the last four years. For example, this does not include RStudio.
  *Note that if you're unaware, almost all Springer books are available through the library*
