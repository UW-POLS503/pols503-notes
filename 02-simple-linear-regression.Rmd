# Simple Linear Regression

*Simple* linear regression, also called *bivariate linear* regression is linear regression with one outcome variable and one covariate,
$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X
$$


## Estimator

The ordinary least squares estimator estimates $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ from the data.


## Properties of the Estimator

- Unbiased
- Consistent
- Asymptotically normal
- Efficiency. An efficient estimator is the estimator with the lowest *standard error*. OLS is BLUE---the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator. This is proven by the *Gauss-Markov Theorem*. For the set of the class of linear, unbiased, estimators (with a few regularity conditions), OLS is the efficient estimator.
