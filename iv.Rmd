# Instrumental Variables


**TODO** path diagram




$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_x X + \beta_z Z + \epsilon
$$
However $X$ is endogenous, meaning $\Cov(X, \epsilon) \neq 0$.

So use an *instrument*, $W$, to model $X$,
$$
X = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 W + \gamma_2 Z + \nu
$$

There are two conditions for this instrument,

Inclusion condition

: $Cov(W, X) \neq 0$

Exclusion condition

: $Cov(W, \epsilon) = 0$. The only association beween $W$ and $Y$ is through the endogenous variable $X$

- No direct test whether $Z$ is correlated with $\epsilon$
- Cannot test by including $Z$ in 2nd stage. If $Z$ is a good instrument - it will explaiin $X$ and thus $Y$
- Instruments need to be justified by arguments outside the mode


## Multiple Instruments

2SLS can also include multiple instruments, e.g.
$$
X = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 W_1 + \gamma_2 W_2 + \gamma_3 W_3 + \gamma_4 Z + \nu
$$

To test whether the instruments predict the endogenous variable: $F$ test of join hypothesis that all instrumental
variables are 0. If there are $k$ instruments,
$$
H_0: \gamma_1 = \dots = \gamma_k
$$

### Overidentification test

- number of instruments = number of endogenuous variables: *just-identified*
- number of instruments > number of endogenuous variables: *over-identified*

- Idea: if each instrument is valid, then using each alone should produce an unbiased estimate of $\beta$
- Test: test that the 2nd stage coefficients ($\beta$) produced by using each instrument are all the same
- Problem: If it rejects it could be two issues

    - bad instruments
    - heterogeneous treatment effects: different subpops of LATE

## Weak Instruments

### Quasi-instruments

*quasi-instrument*: Case in which an instrument, $W$, and the error term, $\epsilon$, are correlated, $\Cov(W, \epsilon) = 0$.
Generally, this should be small.

For OLS,
$$
\plim \hat{beta}_{OLS} = \beta_1 + \cor(X_1, \epsilon) \frac{\sigma_\epsilon}{\sigma_X}
$$
If $\cor(X, \epsilon) \neq 0$, then $\plim \hat{beta}_{OLS} \neq \beta_1$.

For quasi-instrument, $Z$,
$$
\plim \hat{beta}_{2SLS} = \beta_1 + \frac{\Cor(Z, \epsilon)}{\Cor(Z, X_1)} \frac{\sigma_\epsilon}{\sigma_{X_1}}
$$

If $\cor(XZ, \epsilon) = 0$, then $\plim \hat{beta}_{OLS} = \beta_1$.

Otherwise, $\beta_{2SLS}$ is not consistent. Implications

1. As $\Cor(Z, \epsilon) \to 0$, it converges to something closer to $\beta_1$
2. If $\Cor(Z, X_1) \to 0$, meaning the instrument does not explain $Z$ well, then the bias can increase

See @Bailey2016a (p. 303)

### Weak Instruments

Week instruments do not explain the endogenous variable well

- In small samples, 2SLS biased towards OLS. This is worse with multiple instruments.
- More instruments - can explain the endogenous variable better (*in sample*). This
    biases 2SLS towards OLS.
- Diagnosing and testing [@StaigerStock1997a]:

    - For one instrument, $t$ statistic in the 1st stage (> 3) (Staiger and Stock)
    - For multiple instruments, the $F$ stat should be at least 10

## Simultaneous Equation Models

Simultaneous Equation Models (SEM)  

- cases of simultaneous causation: supply and demand, institutions and economic growth
- IV originally developed in SEM literature. SEMs less used now

$$
\begin{aligned}[t]
Y_{1i} &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 Y_{2i} + \beta_2 W_i + \beta_3 Z_{1i} + \epsilon_{1i} \\
Y_{2i} &= \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 Y_{2i} + \gamma_2 W_i + \gamma_3 Z_{2i} + \epsilon_{2i} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

To simultaneously estimate these equations we need instruments for each outcome, that
are not associated (included in the equation) with the other outcome:

- $Y_{1i}$: the instrument is $Z_{1i}$
- $Y_{2i}$: the instrument is $Z_{2i}$

These are *exclusion restrictions* needed for identification of the SEM

*Reduced form* - Regression only as a function of non-endogenous variables.

First stage:
$$
Y_{2i} = \pi_0 + \pi_1 W_i + \pi_2 Z_{1i} + \pi_3 Z_{2i} + \epsilon_i
$$
Second stage:
$$
Y_{1i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \hat{Y}_{2i} + \beta_2 W_i + \beta_3 Z_{1i} + \epsilon_{1i}
$$
where $Y_{1i}$ is the fitted value from the 1st stage.

## Advanced Treatment

*Monotonicity:* The instrument must have the same direction of effect for everyone in the population

*SUTVA:*

    - Treatment doesn't vary in unmeasured ways across individuals
    - No spillovers. Effect of treatment doesn't depend on the treatements of others


## IV with constant treatment

From Blackwell notes

Causal model $Y_i$ has a constant effect an an unmeasured confounder
$$
Y_i(d, u) = \alpha + \tau d + \gamma u + \eta_i
$$
The regression form is
$$
Y_i = \alpha + \tau D_i + \gamma U_i + \eta_i
$$

Suppose $\E(D_i, \eta_i) = 0$.

- If $U$ observed, then $\tau$ consistent
- If $U$ unobserved, then $\Cov(\gamma U_i + \eta_i D_i) \neq 0$ because $U$ is common cause of $D$ and $Y$.





## R IMplementations

Function `r rdoc("AER", "ivreg")` in the `r rpkg("AER")` package is the suggested function to use for IV regression.

The package `r rpkg("ivpack")` adds some additional diagnostic functions.

Other implementations include

- `r rdoc("sem", "tsls")` in the `r rpkg("sem")` package
- `r rpkg("systemfit")` package


## Examples

@Levitt2002a :

- Outcome: Violent Crime
- Endogenous Variable: Police Officers
- Instrument: Firefighters
- Argument: Use funding changes that allow increases in public services as a
    natural experiments. However, police can be hired to deal with violent crime.
    So use firefighters - correlated funding for both. But firefighters do not
    directly decrease crime
