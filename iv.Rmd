# Instrumental Variables

## IV in DAGs

The following graph is a DAG of an instrumental variable:

```{r}
DiagrammeR::grViz(here::here("diagrams", "iv-dag.gv"))
```

- $Y$ is outcome
- $Z$ is instrument
- $D$ is treatment
- $U$ is unmeasured confounder

The **exclusion restriction**

-   No common causes of the instrument ($Z$) and outcome ($Y$).
    Note that $U$ does not point to $Z$.
-   No direct or effect of the the instrument $Z$ on $Y$ except through the treatment $Z$.
    In the DAG, there is not a path from $Z$ to $U$ (indirect effect), or $Z$ to $Y$ (direct effect).
    The only path from $Z$ to $Y$ goes through $D$.

The **first stage** relationship is $Z \leftarrow D$.

IV is as good as its assumptions

-   Hard to find a believe instrument with believable exclusion restrictions.
-   When effects vary, the IV is only a local ATE, local to the instrument.

## IV with Constant Treatment Effects

Causal model for $Y_i$ with unmeasured confounder $U_i$
$$
Y_i(d, u) = \alpha + \tau d + \gamma u + \eta_i
$$
Given an consistency assumption, the regression form is,
$$
Y_i = \alpha + \tau D_i + \gamma U_i + \eta_i
$$

-  Assume $\E(D_i \eta_i) = 0$.
   If we could observe $U_i$ could identify $\tau$. 
-  $\Cov(\gamma U_i + \eta_i, D_i) \neq 0$ since $U$ is common cause of $D$ and $Y$

What does the instrument do? 

Suppose there is an instrument that satisfies the exclusion restriction.
$$
\Cov(\gamma U_i + \eta_i, Z_i) = 0
$$

If must be independent of $U$, and is not correlated with $\eta_i$.
$$
\begin{aligned}[t]
\Cov(\gamma U_i + \eta_i, Z_i) &= \Cov(\alpha + \tau D_i + \gamma U_i + \eta_i, Z_i) \\
&= \Cov(\alpha, Z_i) + \Cov(\tau D_i, Z_i) + \Cov(\gamma U_i + \eta_i, Z_i) \\
&= 0 + \tau \Cov(D_i, Z_i) + 0
\end{aligned}
$$

The average treatment effect is
$$
\tau = \frac{\Cov(Y_i, Z_i)}{\Cov(D_i, Z_i)} = \frac{\Cov(Y_i, Z_i) / \Var(Z_i)}{\Cov(D_i, Z_i) / \Var(Z_i)}
$$

-   **reduced form** is $\Cov(Y_i, Z_i) / \Var(Z_i)$
-   **first stage** is $\Cov(D_i, Z_i) / \Var(Z_i)$

The natural estimator for $\tau$ is
$$
\widehat{\tau}_{IV} = \frac{\widehat{\Cov}(Y_i, Z_i)}{\widehat{\Cov}(D_i, Z_i)}
$$

**weak first stage**: If $\Cov(Z_i, D_i)$ is small, then even small violations in exclusion restriction $\Cov(Z_i, U_i) \neq 0$.

Convey strength of first-stage via a $t$-test or $F$-test with multiple instruments.

With binary instrument, it is the Wald estimator:
$$
\begin{aligned}[t]
\tau &= \frac{\Cov(Y_i, Z_i)}{\Cov(D_i, Z_i)} \\
&= \frac{\E(Y_i | Z_i = 1) - \E(Y_i | Z_i = 0)}{\E(D_i | Z_i = 1) - \E(D_i | Z_i = 0)} \\
&= \frac{\text{effect of instrument on outcome}}{\text{effect of instrument on treatment}}
\end{aligned}
$$

## With Covariates?

What if there is a set of covariates $X_i$ that need to be conditioned on? 

Start with linear models of outcome and treatment.
$$
\begin{aligned}
Y_i &= X'_i \beta + \tau D_i + \epsilon_i \\
D_i &= X'_i \alpha + \gamma Z_i + \nu_i
\end{aligned}
$$
Assume that $X_i$ and $Z_i$ are exogenous:
$$
\begin{aligned}[t]
\E(Z_i \nu_i) &= 0 & \E(Z_i \epsilon_i) &= 0 \\
\E(X_i \nu_i) &= 0 & \E(X_i \epsilon_i) &= 0
\end{aligned}
$$
But $D_i$ is endogenous,
$$
\E(D_i \epsilon_i) \neq 0
$$

Plug the treatment equation into the outcome,
$$
\begin{aligned}[t]
Y_i &= X'_i \beta + \tau(X'_i \alpha + \gamma Z_i + \nu_i) + \epsilon_i \\
&= X'_i \beta + \tau(X'_i \alpha + \gamma Z_i) + (\tau \nu_i + \epsilon_i) \\
&= X'_i + \tau (X'_i \alpha + \gamma Z_i) + \epsilon^*_i \\
&= X'_i \beta + \tau \underbrace{E(D_i | X_i, Z_i)}_{\text{first stage}} + \epsilon_i^*
\end{aligned}
$$
The treatment effect is the predicted value from the first stage,
$$
\E(D_i | X_i, Z_i) = X'_i \alpha + \gamma Z_i .
$$
Estimate $\widehat{\alpha}$ and $\widehat{\gamma}$ from OLS,
$$
\widehat{\E}(D_i | X_i, Z_i) = \hat{D}_i = X'_i \hat{\alpha} + \hat{\gamma} Z_i 
$$
Regress $Y_i$ on $X_i$ and $\hat{D}_i$.

## Two-Stage Least Squares

Heuristic procedure

1.  Regress treatment on covariates and instrument
1.  Construct fitted values of treatment
1.  Regress outcome on covariates and fitted values of treatment

Actual 2SLS estimation is different in order to get standard errors correct.

## Overidentification

-   **Just identified:** Number of instruments equals endogenous variables.
-   **Overidentified:** More instruments than endogenous variables

If overidentified and **constant effects** can use Sargan-Hausman overidentification test

-   Null hypothesis: valid instruments and constant effects, using all instruments vs. a subset should produce the same estimate (differing only by sampling variation)
-   If rejected:

    -   Either constant effects assumption is true and at least one instrument fails its exclusion restriction 
    -   or not constant effects
    

# IV and Potential Outcomes

-   Idea of IV

    -   $D_i$ not randomized
    -   $Z_i$ is randomized
    -   $Z_i$ only affects $Y_i$ through $D_i$

-   $D_i$ now depends on potential outcomes through $Z_i$
-   Consistency
    $$
    D_i = Z_i D_i(1) + (1 - Z_i) D_i(0)
    $$
    
-   Outcome depends on treatment and instrument:
    $Y_i(d, z)$ is the potential outcome if unit $i$ received the 
    treatment $D_i = d$ and instrument value $Z_i = z$.
    
## Assumptions

1.  Randomization
1.  Exclusion Restriction
1.  First-stage relationship
1.  Monotonicity

### Randomization

-   Instrument must be randomized
    $$
    
    $$
-   Can weaken to conditional ignorability (conditioning on other covariates). But why trust conditional ignorability for 
    instrument but not treatment?
    
-   Best instruments are truly randomized
-   This identifies **intent-to-treat (ITT)** effect:
    $$
    E(Y_i | Z_i = 1) - E(Y_i | Z_i = 0) = E(Y_i(D_i(1)), 1) - Y_i(D_i(0), 0)
    $$
    Intent-to-treat is the causal effect of the instrument

### Exclusion restriction
    
Instrument has no direct effect on outcome, once the value of the treatment is fixed.
$$
Y_i(d, 1) = Y_i(d, 0)  \text{ for } d = 0, 1 .
$$

Potential outcomes for each treatment only depend on the treatment, not the instrument.
$$
\begin{aligned}[t]
Y_i(1) = Y_i(1, 1) = Y_i(1, 0) \\
Y_i(0) = Y_i(0, 1) = Y_i(0, 0) 
\end{aligned}
$$

Rewrite $Y_i$ as a regression using consistency:
$$
\begin{aligned}[t]
Y_i &= Y_i(0) + (Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)) D_i \\
&= \alpha_0 + \tau_i D_i + \eta_i
\end{aligned}
$$
where
$$
\begin{aligned}[t]
\alpha_0 &= E(Y_i(0)) \\
\tau_i &= Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)
\end{aligned}
$$

### First Stage

Obvious, but important. The instrument must have an effect on the treatment.
$$
E(D_i(1) - D_i(0)) \neq 0
$$
or
$$
\Cov(D_i, Z_i) \neq 0 .
$$

### Monotonicity

The presence of the instrument never dissuades someone from taking the treatment.
Alternatively, the treatment always at least weaky improves the probability of someone taking the treatment.
$$
D_i(1) - D_i(0) \geq 0
$$
or the alternative direction depending on the scale of $D$.
But it always needs to be in the same direction.

Called **no defiers**

With binary treatment and binary instrument, there are four combinations (called **prinicpal strata**):

| Name          | $D_i(1)$ | $D_i(0)$ |
|---------------|----------|----------|
| Always takers | 1        | 1        |
| Never Takers  | 0        | 0        | 
| Compliers     | 1        | 0        |
| Defiers       | 0        | 1        |

**Monotonicity** assumption is that there are **no defiers**.

Given the values of $Z_i$ and $D_i$, the possible (unobserved) 
stata for $i$ are:

| $Z_i$    | $D_i$    | Possible Strata        |
|----------|----------|------------------------|
| 1        | 1        | Always taker, Complier |
| 0        | 0        | Never taker, Complier  |
| 1        | 0        | Never taker            |
| 0        | 1        | Always taker           |

In particular, if someone receives the instrument and takes treatment, they could be a complier who only took the treatment because they received the instrument and would have not taken the treatment if they had not, or an always-taker and would have taken the treatment regardless of whether they received the treatment or not.

### Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE)

With those assumptions, the Wald estimator is equal to the local average treatment effecte (LATE) or the complier average treatment effect (CATE)

The LATE is the ATE averaged over compliers only.

$$
\frac{\E(Y_i | Z_i = 1) - \E(Y_i | Z_i = 0)}{\E(D_i | Z_i = 1) - \E(D_i | Z_i = 0)} = E(Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) | D_i(1) > D_i(0))
$$

-   This is **big**. Once we allow for heterogeneous effects, the IV only estimates a causal effect among compliers.
-   This subset is unknown:
    
    -   treated units are mix of always takers and compliers
    -   control units are mix of never takers and compliers

-   With no further assumptions: $\tau_{LATE} \neq \tau_{ATE}$
-   Complier group varies with instrument. Different instruments mean different complier groups.
-   2SLS assumes that the effect is constant and thus ignores this.

### One-sided noncopliance

When non-compliance is one-sided, then LATE is equal to the ATT

Randomized experiment

-   Randomized treatement assignment is the instrument $Z_i$
-   Non-random actual treatment take is the treatment $D_i$

One-sided non-compliance because only those assigned to treatment can actually take the treatment:
$$
\Pr(D_i = 1 | Z_i = 0) = 0
$$
If one-sided compliance, then the IV estimates the average treatment on the treated (ATT),
$$
\frac{E(Y_i | Z_i = 1) - E(Y_i | Z_i = 0)}{\Pr(D_i = 1 | Z_i = 1)} = \E(Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) | D_i = 1) .
$$

### Extensions

-   Falsification tests
-   Cannot identify who is a complier, can estimate the size
    of the complier group, and features of the complier group
    
-   Multiple instruments. This means multiple LATEs
-   When 2SLS used with multiple instruments it is a
    weighted average of the LATEs from each instrument.
