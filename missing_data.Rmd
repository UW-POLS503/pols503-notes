# Missing Data 


The short summary of misisng data is "listwise deletion" is almost always worse than "multiple imputation". 

[This blog post]( https://www.rstudio.com/rviews/2016/11/30/missing-values-data-science-and-r/) has a good overview of packages handling missing data in R (as of November 2016).
Of these, the two major packages are:

- `r rpkg("Amelia")`: See @HonakerKingBlackwell2011a, @BlackwellHonakerKing2015a, and @HonakerKing2010a.
- `r rpkg("mice")`: See !BuurenGroothuis-Oudshoorn2011a

Currently I suggest using **mice**, as it is more flexible in the types of data that it can handle.
