## Regression

- David A Freedman (2009). Statistical Models: Theory and Practice. 2nd Edition. Cambridge University Press. An excellent, concise, and brilliantly skeptical graduate level statistics text- books covering mainstream topics. A great reference for understanding the assumptions and theorems behind regression.
- Richard A Berk (2004). Regression Analysis: A Constructive Critique. London: Sage Publica- tions Ltd. Like an easy reading version of Freedman. Very skeptical. Agonizes over assump- tions. Refreshing reading whenever one is facing regressions.
- Jeffrey Wooldridge (2008). Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data, 2nd Edi- tion. In my opinion, the best graduate level econometric textbook. Covers almost all topics, but with a subtle awareness to lurking issues of causal inference and the importance of assumptions.
