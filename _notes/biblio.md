## Topics

## Math Prefreshers and Linear Algebra

These are a few resources to use to catch up

- Moore and Siegel: "A Mathematics Cours for Political and Social Research"
- [Kahn Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math) has lectures on most of the things that you would need to know.
    For example [Stats and Prob](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/), and
    [Linear Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra).

- Strang: "Linear Algebra"

    - Associated MIT Course on [Open Course Ware](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/)

- Simon and Blume. 1994. "Mathematics for Economists" This was/is the standard
    math prefresher text for economics. This could be a good reference to have
    on hand for the future as a concise compilation of the maths that you may or may
    not know.

- Harvard University [Math Prefresher](http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/prefresher/node/8797)


## Statistics

Basic Introductions to Statistics. There are many: here are some.

- [OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/). There is also an associated
    [Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics),
    and associated materials for the course at [Duke](https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel/sta101_sp15).
- Moore et al. "Introduction to the Practice of Statistics." David S. Moore was an innovator
    in statistical education, and this is one of the most widely used texts. It only uses HS algebra
    but has good intuition.
- Chance, Cobb et al. "Statistical Investigations"
- Wilcox: Basic Statistics: Understanding Conventional Methods and Modern Insights. A textbook that
    came out of the [MOSAIC Project](http://mosaic-web.org/) which aims to improve math education with
    computation.
- Freedman, Pisani and Purves. "Statistics". At only a slightly higher level than the previous,
    but Freedman is able to rigorously discuss stats concepts even if the maths aren't.
- Imai "Quantitative Social Science: An Introduction" A modern data analysis/stats book that focuses
    on causal inference and intuition first. Its examples are drawn from recent social science work.

Data Sciency introductions:

- Brian Caffo. Statistical inference for data science. A text from the John Hopkins Coursera [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science).
- Downey "[Think Stats](http://thinkstats2.com/)", a Python and programming centric introduction to stats.

More advanced grad-level treatments of probability and statistics:

- Casella and Berger. "Statistical Inference"
- Wasserman. "All of Statistics"

Probability

Probability is a prerequisite, but not the same as stats. These are a couple introductions.

- Chen and Blitzstein [Probability Cheatsheet v 2.0](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54bf3241e4b0f0d81bf7ff36/t/55e9494fe4b011aed10e48e5/1441352015658/probability_cheatsheet.pdf)
- Bersekas and Tsitsiklis. "Introduction to Probability"
- Blitzstein and Hwang "Introduciton to Probability"


Miscellaneous:

- Reinhart "Statistics Done Wrong" A supplementary book that provides intuition for some common statistical
    mistakes.
- Carnegie Mellon [Statistical Reasoning](http://oli.cmu.edu/courses/free-open/statistical-reasoning-course-details/) Open Learning Course.


## R

One of the best ways to learn R is through interactive programming courses:

- [Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com/)
- [swirl](http://swirlstats.com/)

Here are a few good introductions to R:

- Wickham and Grolemund. *R for Data Science*
- Kabakoff. *[R in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/r-in-action)*
- Lander. *[R for Everyone](http://www.jaredlander.com/r-for-everyone/)*

These focus on the programming aspects of R:

- Matloff. *[Art of R programming](https://www.nostarch.com/artofr.htm)*
- Wickham. *[R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/)*
- Wickham. *[Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/)*
