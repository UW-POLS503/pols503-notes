- Be systematic, be consistent.
- The source and original data are real - everything else is temporary
- Treat data as read only
- Use paths relative to the project root. Never use `setwd`, never include absolute paths.
- Encapsulate everything in one directory
- Separate raw data from derived data
- Separate data from code
- Choose file names carefully (never use "final")
- Include a README file which explains what's in the directory.
