## Predictions



## Marginal Effects

The marginal effect of a regressor is the change in the outcome variable associated with a small change in the predictor,
For a predictor with only a linear term,
$$
\vec{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \vec{x}_1 ,
$$
the marginal effect is the regression coefficient,
$$
\frac{\partial \vec{y}}{\partial \vec{x}} = \beta_1 .
$$

However, if a predictor appears in multiple terms, the marginal effect will be a more complicated function.
For example, if $x$ appears as a squared term and an interaction,
$$
\vec{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \vec{x} + \beta_2 \vec{x}^2 + \beta_3 \vec{z} + \beta_4 \vec{x} \vec{z} + \beta_5 \vec{x} \vec{z}^2
$$
then its marginal effect is a function of both its current value, $\vec{x}$, and the value of $\vec{z}$,
$$
\frac{\partial \vec{y}}{\partial \vec{x}} = \beta_1 + 2 \beta_2 \vec{x} + \beta_4 \vec{z} + 2 \beta_5 \vec{x} \vec{z}
$$
